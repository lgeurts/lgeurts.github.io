I'm a Technical Team Lead and (Cloud) Platforms Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life I was a Microsoft PFE, T3 Escalation Engineer at Dell, HP Support Escalation Engineer ... A career stretching back to the MS-DOS era early 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people of which I can call some a close friend. Great times, until I discovered there was nothing new to explore, stuck in a career with no chance to grow. So, after a long period of doubt (was giving up a good paying job without even knowing what to do next) I quit, booked a flight to Paris and started as a one-man-shop.

Looking back now, and despite the pitfalls, probably one of my best decisions.

What else? I'm interested in far too much topics ranging from science to history, philosophy, robotics, kendo and kenjutsu, grade 3 ice climbing, trekking, playing drums, gaming, traveling planet earth, foreign languages, and many more.
