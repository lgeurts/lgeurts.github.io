I am a self-employed DevOps and Cloud Platforms Engineer, living in the central north of France.
In a former life I was a Microsoft PFE, T3 Escalation Engineer at Dell, HP Support Escalation Engineer ... A career stretching back to the MS-DOS era early 1995.

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people  of which I can call some a close friend. Sounds great? It is. But I also discovered I could not imagine me doing the same old 'new' things for the rest of my life. Personal growth; stepping out of the comfort zone has always been my primary drive and what's better than having to depend on your own, on your own intuition? So I jumped into the deep, switched to the uncertainty of a one-man shop, and am loving every minute of it.

What else? I'm interested in far too much topics ranging from science to history, philosophy, robotics, open source, ice climbing, trekking, kendo & kenjutsu, playing drums, gaming, traveling planet earth, foreign languages, and many more.
