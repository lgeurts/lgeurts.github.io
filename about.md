A native from Belgium with partly Irish blood in his veins. Moved between a lot of countries, now dwelling in the beautiful north of France.

Before starting as a Tech Lead & Engineering Consultant I spent 22 years working with and for large multinational corporations like Microsoft, Dell, HP, and British Telecom. 

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people of which I can call some a close friend. Great times, until I discovered there was nothing new to explore, stuck in a career with no chance to grow. So, after a long period of doubt (was giving up a good paying job without even knowing what to do next) I quit, booked a flight to Paris and started as a one-man-shop. Regrets? No. I've had my share of blunders and absurdities creeping in, but never would go back.

What else? I'm interested in far too much topics ranging from science to history, astronomy, robotics, kendo and iaijutsu, mixed ice climbing, trekking the French Alps, my (2008) GSXR-600, rehearsing paradiddles, learning Gaelic, and more.
