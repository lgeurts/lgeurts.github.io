I’m a Tech Lead & Engineering Consultant, native from Belgium with Dutch and Irish ancestors, an expat now dwelling in the beautiful north of France.

I spent 16 years of my life at multinational corporations like Microsoft, Dell, HP, and British Telecom - climbing the ladder while working on a bunch of Windows Server (sometimes Unix) flavors, running crazy projects, spreading the gospel at  all kinds of customer technical trainings. 

Learned a lot and met amazingly talented people of which I can call some a close friend. Great times, until I discovered there was nothing new to explore, stuck in a career with no chance to grow. So, after a long period of doubt (was giving up a good paying job without even knowing what to do next) I quit, booked a flight to Paris and started as a one-man-shop. Any regrets? Do I miss the bag of company stock options? No. I've had my share of blunders and absurdities creeping in, but never would go back.

What else? I'm interested in far too much topics ranging from science to history, astronomy, robotics, kendo and iaijutsu, mixed ice climbing, trekking the French Alps, my (2008) GSXR-600, rehearsing paradiddles, learning Gaelic, and more.
