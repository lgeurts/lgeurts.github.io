Since I was talking about editors, next to Vim, Acme is on of my favs too. Nothing but yellow windows and blue bars on the screen, written by Rob Pike for Plan 9 in the early 1990s.
Acme focuses entirely on the idea of text as user interface. It's difficult to explain acme without seeing it, though, so I've put together a screencast explaining the basics of acme and showing a brief programming session. Remember as you watch the video that the 854x480 screen is quite cramped. Usually you'd run acme on a larger screen: even my MacBook Air has almost four times as much screen real estate.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) is 'flying' through commands and concepts, which makes it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbs and regular users alike.
ins, a 200 lines long .vimrc file that completely changes how Vim works, and bad advise given by people who know nothing about VI.
