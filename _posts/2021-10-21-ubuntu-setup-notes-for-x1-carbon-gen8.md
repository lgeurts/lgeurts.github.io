This guide was written to help me when re-installing Ubuntu Groovy Gorilla. Despite this system is now out of support I do not upgrade to a higher version as I just see no reasoning. Newer features? For what I do I don't need them. Security? I do most work offline, and for the few times I want to read my mail or react in Slack, I trust my firewall being enough. For social media, gaming, all the regular tim wasting activities, I have a Windows 10 laptop, for real work, Linux.
