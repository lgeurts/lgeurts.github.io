These notes were written to **help me out** should I ever have to re-install Groovy Gorilla & all extra packages. 

You'll probably ask why I am using an older distro. Despite being out of support I see no reason to upgrade (yet). New features? Latest Gnome? Don't need them. Security? I mostly work offline, and for those few times I want to read mail or talk in Slack with my team mates, my trusted firewall should be enough. Anyways, for social media, browsing, gaming, all those regular time wasting activities with a risk of getting infected, or in any way cracked/hacked, those are restricted to a default Windows 10 installation which contains no private data whatsoever. Issues? Wipe and re-image.
