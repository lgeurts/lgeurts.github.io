These notes were written to **help me out** should I ever have to re-install Groovy Gorilla & all extra packages. 

You'll probably ask why I am using an older distro. Despite being out of support I see no reason to upgrade (yet). New features? Latest Gnome? Don't need them. Security? I mostly work offline and for those few times I want to read mail or talk in Slack with my teammates, my trusted firewall should be enough. Social media, web-browsing, gaming, any activities bearing a risk of getting infected or hacked, are restricted to a sandboxed Windows 10 installation containing no private data whatsoever. Issues? Wipe and reload.

So. let's get on with the notes.
