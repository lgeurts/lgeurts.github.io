This guide was written to help me should I have to re-install Groovy Gorilla. You'll probably ask why I'm using an older distro. Despite being out of support there is no reason to upgrade (yet). New features? Latest Gnome? Don't need them. Security? I do most work offline, and for the few times I want to read my mail or talk in Slack with my team mates, my trusted firewall should be enough. Anyways, for social media, browsing, gaming, all those regular time wasting activities with a risk of getting infected, or in any way cracked/hacked, those are restricted to a default Windows 10 installation which contains no private data whatsoever. Issues? Wipe and re-image.
