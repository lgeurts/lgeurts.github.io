This guide was written to help me should I have to re-install Ubuntu Groovy Gorilla. You'll probably ask why an older distro? Despite being out of support I do not upgrade as I just see no reasoning. Newer features for what? Gnome 4? I  don't need them. Security? I do most work offline, and for the few times I want to read my mail or talk in Slack with my team mates, I trust my firewall being enough. Anyways, for social media, browsing, gaming, all those regular time wasting activities with a risk of getting infected, or in any way cracked/hacked, those are restricted to a default Windows 10 installation which contains no private data whatsoever. Issues? Wipe and re-image.
