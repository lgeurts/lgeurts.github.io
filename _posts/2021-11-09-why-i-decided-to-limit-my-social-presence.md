A few years ago something totally unexpected happened. It was at the end of the day and I was fully prepared to move behind my laptop at the home office. Instead I decided to do something else, not spend the evening on what became a daily routine; tweeting, liking posts on my LinkedIn, uploading fresh images on Instagram, reading messages in Slack, scouring Internet sites for articles to read and learn.

Being away from my computer felt like something special. I started living regular life, spending my free time as any other guy would do, watching old movies with J. (my  girlfriend), playing with our 3 dogs on the beach, going out with friends. 

I could have spent time behind this blog as well, but I chose not to. Finally I was able to get a clear head, think about how I used my computer, and phone, how I perhaps consumed and processed more information than I really wanted to and what the long term effects of that do to a person.

In periods I can burn a lot of time tinkering with all kinds of hardware, Linux and open source software! I’m that introvert perfectionist with a slight touch of OCD who gets a bit too obsessed about particular things and I can’t really let anything go before I’m done with it. > *In the past this actually led to a few years of unhealthy multiplayer gaming (CS:GO), so it’s not something I take lightly.* 

In the back of my head I knew I had to take counter-measures to prevent falling back in the same trap, and letting my mind go on the loose again. 

So, first task, I started with disposing old harddisks, floppy's, zipdrives, network cables, a Pentium Pro desktop, even an old SPARCstation. All the awesome stuff you usually gather when working years in IT. Sometimes it was a painful activity because you feel bonded with objects that link to good memories from the past. 

Anyways, this was a big step in de-cluttering my life and it has made some huge positive improvements on my productivity and what I call my hyper-focus. 

I also realized that while my workflow had improved a lot, I still did some really weird things that a younger me would never ever have approved. 

One of those things was, for example, leaving applications open and running in the background on my PC even when I was not there. I know this sounds rather silly, but closing an application when I don’t use it does help focus on what I’m doing. For that reason I also replaced the OS on my daily driver with vanilla Debian and [I3WM](https://i3wm.org/) on vanilla Debian. (See? I told you it's not exclusively about scoring points on [LinuxPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxPorn/) amongst my fellow dorks!)

When it comes to social media, I’m that person who can’t just leave them unread. I must read them to be able to relax and put them behind me so to speak. That’s why I took the third big step. I became picky about what channels to subscribe to, and made an agreement that at a certain time in the evening I would stop no matter how much my desire to keep hanging on (if I don't I have to take her out to a fancy diner). After some time I realized that I didn’t really have any desire to read all the potentially new and fancy articles. I enjoyed the nothingness and all the extra time I had on my hands more than anything. I did eventually launch my feed reader [Newsboat]([https://newsboat.org/) but closed it moments later after a quick glance of the new articles and I then fired up Vim to review all of my feeds.

I removed about 80% of my feeds. Most of them were other weblogs and various tech and/or open source related projects and news sites. One of the first feeds was CNN that posts daily—multiple times per day—about everything from movie trailers, science and tech to politics. This source was pretty good at giving me various highlights about the world and what was going on, but in the end I decided that it took more than what it was worth to keep up with it.

I don't watch TV channels. We both don't. Netflix is enough. No more ads filled with products we are never going to buy.

Last week I took the final step, I went to my current customer and told them I needed a number of days off for studies. Yes, every day not worked when you are a freelancer is money lost, but at the end those certifications are a long-term investment that pays for itself.

Something to think about for you dear reader, since we have a limited quota of time in this world, why not rather spend that on things and people that we find fun, that bring joy and that keep us productive?

So. I hope you understand and don’t feel offended if I don’t follow you on social media, it’s nothing personal. It's for the good of me, and you.
