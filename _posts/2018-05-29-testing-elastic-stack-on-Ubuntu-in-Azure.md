ELK aka Elastic Stack is a combination of 3 very popluar open source applications named [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

They are used for searching, analyzing and visualizing logs and data. 
Elasticsearch is a distributed, real time, scalable and highly available application to store logs and search
through them. Logstash gathers the logs sent by Beats, enhances it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch. 
Kibana is the web UI used to visualize the logs and actionable insights.
