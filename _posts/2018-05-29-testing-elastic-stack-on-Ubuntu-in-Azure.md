ELK or Elastic Stack is a combination of 3 very popluar open source applications named [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

Elasticsearch is a distributed, real time, scalable and highly available application to store and search logs. Logstash gathers the logs sent by Beats, enhances it, and then sends it to Elasticsearch. Kibana is the web UI used to visualize the logs and actionable insights.
