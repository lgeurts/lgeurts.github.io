ELK or Elastic Stack is a combination of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch), [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash), and [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana).

Elasticsearch is a distributed, real time, scalable and highly available application to store and search logs. Logstash gathers the logs sent by [Beats](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats), and sends them to Elasticsearch. Kibana is the Web UI you'll use to visualize logs and actionable insights.
