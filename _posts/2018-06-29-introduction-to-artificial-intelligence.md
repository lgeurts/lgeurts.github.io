**Day 1: What is Machine Learning?**

Machine learning provides the foundation for artificial intelligence. We train our software model using data e.g. the model learns from the training cases and then we use the trained model to make predictions for new data cases.
We start with a data set that contains historical records. Each record includes numerical values (X) that quantify a characteristic of the item we're working with. 
There are also values we try to predict (Y).
