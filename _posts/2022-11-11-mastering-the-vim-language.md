I used Vim exclusively in order to become more efficient with it. I printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard, sticky notes on my screen. I also ran the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. I wrote tons of articles and documentation. Me and Vim were ok till I saw this video and realized I had been living in blissful ignorance.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) ***is flying*** through commands and concepts, making it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbies or users like myself. If anything, this is the beginning of my new journey into the depths of Vim's grammar.
