For the past few years I used Vim almost exclusively to become efficient with it. I printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard, had sticky notes on my screen. ran the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. 

I wrote tons of articles and documentation. Me and Vim were ok till I saw this video and realized I had been living in blissful ignorance, solely relying on plugins, over 100 lines in my .vimrc, and advise given by people who know nothing about pure VI.

If anything, this will be the beginning of my new journey into the depths of Vim’s grammar.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) ***is flying*** through commands and concepts, making it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbs and regular users alike.
