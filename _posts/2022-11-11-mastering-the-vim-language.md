I remember when nano was my favorite editor, living in blissful ignorance not knowing any of the crap I know today. I was focused on the work I did, not on the tools I was using to get the work done. This was not only minimalism at heart, but it was in fact in many ways also the most productive.

And then I saw Vim. I decided to use it exclusively in order to become more efficient with it. I printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard, stcky notes on my screen. I also ran the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. I wrote tons of articles and documentation. Me and Vim were ok till I saw this video. The aha moment, realizing I was reading the wrong blog posts and watching the wrong tutorials - I knew nothing and none of these people really knew vi either.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) ***is flying*** through commands and concepts, making it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbies or users like myself. If anything, this is the beginning of my new journey into the depths of Vim's grammar.
