For the past few years I used Vim almost exclusively to become efficient with it. I printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard, had sticky notes on my screen, ran the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. 

I wrote code, countless articles and documentation. Me and Vim we were ok till I watched this video and realized I had been living in blissful ignorance, relying on plugins, a 200 lines long .vimrc file that completely changes how Vim works, and bad advise given by people who know nothing about pure VI.

If anything, here starts my new journey into the depths of Vim’s grammar.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) is flying through commands and concepts, which makes it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbs and regular users alike.
