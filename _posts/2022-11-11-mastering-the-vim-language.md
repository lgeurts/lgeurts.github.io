For the past few years I used Vim almost exclusively to become efficient with it.  
I wrote code, countless articles and documentation. Me and Vim we were ok till I watched this video and realized I had been living in blissful ignorance, relying on plugins, a 200 lines long .vimrc file that completely changes how Vim works, and bad advise given by people who know nothing about pure VI.

Looks like I'll have to start a new journey into the depths of Vim’s grammar.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) is 'flying' through commands and concepts, which makes it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbs and regular users alike.
