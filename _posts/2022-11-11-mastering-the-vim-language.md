What makes Vim so rewarding to work with? 

Well, you ***can literally do stuff in minutes*** that would take hours in a regular text editor, even in more powerful modern editors such as Sublime Text, Atom or Visual Studio Code. 

So, a few years ago I decided to use Vim exclusively in order to become more efficient with it. I printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard. I also took the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials.

And then I saw this video and realized I lived in blissful ignorance, I had been reading the wrong blog posts and watching the wrong tutorials - none of these people really understood vi either, and they where just passing along all their bad habits.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) ***is flying*** through commands and concepts, making it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbies or users like myself. If anything, this is the beginning of my new journey into the depths of Vim's grammar.
