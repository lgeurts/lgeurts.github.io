For the past few years I used Vim almost exclusively to become more efficient with it. I even printed out a cheat sheet which I placed beside my keyboard, sticky notes on my screen. I also ran the Vimtutor and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. I wrote tons of articles and documentation. Me and Vim were ok till I saw this video and realized I had been living in blissful ignorance.

If anything, this will be the beginning of my new journey into the depths of Vim’s grammar.

Please note that [Chris Toomey](https://ctoomey.com/) ***is flying*** through commands and concepts, making it quite difficult to follow for Vim newbs and regular users alike.
