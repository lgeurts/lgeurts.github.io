Note on confidentiality
-----------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party Mail Service Provider. The staff who work at the provider are technically able to read all my incoming & outgoing mail. This is how email infrastructures work, and it is irrelevant whether SSL or another encryption is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. 

If your message is private, use PGP/GPG encryption to secure communications.

Note on integrity of my emails
------------------------------

All email sent by me from the protonmail account should be signed with GPG.
