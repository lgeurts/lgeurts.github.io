Note on confidentiality
-----------------------

Please note that, as most other people and organizations, I use a 3rd party Mail Service Provider. The staff who work at the provider are technically able to read all incoming & outgoing mail. This is how a email infrastructure works, and it's irrelevant whether SSL or another encryption is used between email clients and corresponding email servers. 

If your message is private, use **PGP/GPG** encryption to secure communications.

Note on integrity of my emails
------------------------------

All email sent from my [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) account should be signed with GPG.
