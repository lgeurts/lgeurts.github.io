COMMAND-T
To ignore specific files:
• set wildignore+=*.log,*.sql,*.cache
Reindex all files by simply pressing <Leader>+r:
• noremap <Leader>r :CommandTFlush<CR>

NERDTREE
Hit the right arrow to open a node:
• let NERDTreeMapActivateNode='<right>'
Display hidden files:
• let NERDTreeShowHidden=1
Toggle display of the tree with <Leader>+n:
• nmap <leader>n :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
Locate the focused file in the tree with <Leader>+j:
• nmap <leader>j :NERDTreeFind<CR>
Always open the tree when booting Vim, but don’t focus:
• autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree
• autocmd VimEnter * wincmd p 
Do not display useless files when looking in the tree:
• let NERDTreeIgnore=['\.DS_Store', '\~$', '\.swp']

GIT GUTTER
Displays the diff in the gutter and allows you to do actions on it. 
Best function, preview a change with <Leader>+hp and revert any change on a line with <Leader>+hr.
I like gutter always displayed - even when there are no changes:
• let g:gitgutter_sign_column_always=1
